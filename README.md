# Diabetes Prediction Model


This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether individuals have diabetes or not. The dataset used in the project is part of a large dataset maintained by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in the United States. The data was collected as part of a diabetes study conducted on Pima Indian women aged 21 and over in Phoenix, the fifth-largest city in the state of Arizona.

## Dataset Details

- **Number of Observations:** 768
- **Number of Variables:** 9
- **Size:** 24 KB
- **Target Variable:** "Outcome" (1: Positive result for diabetes, 0: Negative result for diabetes)

### Variables and Descriptions

1. **Pregnancies:** Number of pregnancies for the individual.
2. **Glucose:** 2-hour plasma glucose concentration measured during an oral glucose tolerance test.
3. **Blood Pressure:** Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
4. **Skin Thickness:** Thickness of the skin for the individual.
5. **Insulin:** 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
6. **Diabetes Pedigree Function:** A function calculated based on the oral glucose tolerance test's 2-hour plasma glucose concentration.
7. **BMI (Body Mass Index):** Body mass index of the individual.
8. **Age:** Age of the individual (years).
9. **Outcome:** Target variable indicating whether the individual has diabetes (1: Yes, 0: No).

## Project Stages

1. **Data Analysis:** Basic characteristics of the dataset, missing values, outliers, and statistical features will be explored.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Operations will be performed on existing features, new features will be created, and the dataset will be prepared for the machine learning model.
3. **Model Development:** A machine learning model will be created based on the selected features. The model's performance will be evaluated using training and test datasets.
4. **Results and Comments:** A detailed report will be prepared on the success rates of the model, significant features, and suggestions for improvement.
